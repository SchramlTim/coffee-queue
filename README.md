#### ☕️ WIP: Coffee queue counter ☕️

Author: Tim Schraml.

This is a fun project to create a coffe queue counter using YoloV3 for object detection.
Also there is a Flask server which provides a web dashboard.

Future idea: get setup run on a raspberry pi

#### Setup 💿
run the following commands in order

* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python get_weights.py
* python webcam_counter.py
* python server.py

now you can find on localhost:5000 your dashboard

##### Special Thanks 🎁🎈
